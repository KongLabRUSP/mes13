Dear Dr. Kong:    
    
As a courtesy, we send reminder notices before revised manuscripts are due. Your manuscript, tx-2019-00117k.R1, "DNA methylome and transcriptome alterations in high glucose-induced diabetic nephropathy cellular model and identification of novel targets for treatment by Tanshinone IIA," is due on 26-Jul-2019.  The manuscript is scheduled to be inactivated after that date. If you need more time to complete your revised paper, please let us know by replying to this e-mail.    
    
Sincerely,

Dear Davit    

I am trying to answer questions raised by CRT reviewers, could you please try to help me to answer the following? Thanks a lot.    

**1. Figure 1 legend, "HF vs LG" should be "HG vs LG"? The Y axis should use same difference range for the two figures in Figure 1.**       
Could you please change Y axis to use the same range?    
     
**2. Most of the figures are of insufficient resolution, and the labels are too small to see.**     
Maybe try to reduce some labels?    
    
**3. The authors employed SureSelect Methyl-seq to analyze DNA methylation, but they do not describe what genes/CpG sutes are included in this analysis. They should provide more information abut this methodology and also more experimental details such as DNA amounts etc.**    
1ug DNA? Could you please add some more description?    
    
**4. The section entitled "SureSelect Methyl-seq analysis" is not written clearly. The author state that "overall methylation levels differed by the region but not by treatment" and yest in the next section entitled "Correlation of SureSelect Methyl-seq results with RNA-seq results" they conduct a correlation analysis between DNA methylation and gene expression changes. Did they observe treatment-related changes in methylation or not? Methylation results should be shown as a heatmap.**    
Could you please add one heatmap graph for methylation?

Dear Dr. Wang    
We have improved our figures according to your request and attached a supplement table 1 to elaborate on figure 3. The manuscript has been modified accrodingly as well. Hope those work will meet your requirments. Thanks.
